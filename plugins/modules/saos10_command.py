module: saos10_command
author:
  - Jeff Groom (@jgroom33)
short_description: Run commands on remote devices running Ciena SAOS 10
description:
- Sends arbitrary commands to a saos node and returns the results read from the device.
  This module includes an argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific
  condition before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.
version_added: 1.0.0
notes:
- Tested against SAOS 10-4
options:
  commands:
    description:
    - List of commands to send to the remote saos device over the configured provider.
      The resulting output from the command is returned. If the I(wait_for) argument
      is provided, the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or
      the number of retries has expired. If a command sent to the device requires
      answering a prompt, it is possible to pass a dict containing I(command), I(answer)
      and I(prompt). Common answers are 'y' or "\\r" (carriage return, must be double
      quotes). See examples.
    required: true
    type: list
    elements: str
  wait_for:
    description:
    - List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the command. The task will
      wait for each condition to be true before moving forward. If the conditional
      is not true within the configured number of retries, the task fails. See examples.
    aliases:
    - waitfor
    type: list
    elements: str
  match:
    description:
    - The I(match) argument is used in conjunction with the I(wait_for) argument to
      specify the match policy.  Valid values are C(all) or C(any).  If the value
      is set to C(all) then all conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied.  If
      the value is set to C(any) then only one of the values must be satisfied.
    default: all
    type: str
    choices:
    - any
    - all
  retries:
    description:
    - Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried before it is considered
      failed. The command is run on the target device every retry and evaluated against
      the I(wait_for) conditions.
    default: 10
    type: int
  interval:
    description:
    - Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If
      the command does not pass the specified conditions, the interval indicates how
      long to wait before trying the command again.
    default: 1
    type: int
